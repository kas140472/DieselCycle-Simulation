#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforce theoretical concept, Experimentation

<u>About the Experiment:</u><br>

Diesel cycle is a thermodynamics cycle used to describe the working of a compression ignition (diesel) engine. It describes how the chemical energy of gasoline is turned into thermal energy, which is then used to power the motion of a diesel vehicle. For a diesel engine, only the air is compressed during the cycle, and the fuel is introduced during the combustion phase.

The various processes involved are explained below:

0-1 - Intake phase, which is an isobaric process that takes the air into the engine chamber, as the piston goes to BDC.

1-2 - This is the isentropic compression phase, where the air is compressed by the piston as it goes up. At 2, the fuel is injected into the chamber through the fuel injection pump.

2-3 - This is the constant pressure heat addition, where the air-fuel mixture undergoes combustion. The combustion of the mixture is complete at 3 and is at maximum pressure and high thermal energy.

3-4 - This is the isentropic expansion phase, where the thermal energy performs work on the piston, pushing it down so that the volume increases. This is the power stroke, as this provides motion for the vehicle.

4-1 - This is the constant volume heat rejection phase, where the remaining wasted heat is expelled from the engine chamber. The pressure reduces as the kinetic energy of the gas molecules goes down.

1-0 - The remaining exhaust gases are removed from the chamber through a constant pressure method.

In this experiment, the Diesel cycle is demonstrated so that the user can understand how the P-V graph changes as various pressure and volume parameters change and the corresponding piston changes as well.

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository</u>
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
The experiment consists of the Diesel cycle P-V graph. All the buttons and parameters control the right corner of the frame. The variable panel contains sliders for the pressures P1 and P3 and the volumes V1 and V3 and the heat capacity ratio γ.

The setup consists of a graph that depicts the Diesel cycle. A legend at the top indicates the processes involved in each of the curves. There is also a piston-cylinder made up of a top-open rectangle and the piston made up of another rectangle that passes through the cylinder.

By changing the various parameters, the P-V graph changes and the piston moves up and down indicating the various processes in accordance with the change in the graph.


1. The initial P1 is taken as 4 kPa.<br>
2. The initial P3 is taken as 50 kPa.<br>
3. The initial V1 is taken as 15 m<sup>3</sup>/kg.<br>
4. The initial V3 is taken as 7 m<sup>3</sup>/kg.<br>
5. The initial heat capacity ratio γ is taken as 1.5.<br>
6. P1 is varied from 4 to 6 kPa using a slider.<br>
7. P3 is varied from 50 to 60 kPa using a slider.<br>
8. V1 is varied from 15 to 20 m<sup>3</sup>/kg using a slider.<br>
9. V3 is varied from 7 to 11 m<sup>3</sup>/kg using a slider.<br>
10. The heat capacity ratio γ is varied from 1.5 to 1.68 using a slider.<br>

Change the parameters of the system to understand the behaviour of the Diesel cycle.
